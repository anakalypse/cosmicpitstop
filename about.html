                <p><strong>Astrologer & Palmist</strong></p>

                <p>Shaun Mattingly works with <strong>True Sidereal Astrology</strong>, a system that focuses on the actual constellation sizes in the sky at the time of your birth. Unlike traditional astrology, True Sidereal incorporates all constellations along the ecliptic — including <strong>Ophiuchus</strong>, often left out of mainstream charts.</p>

                <p>Shaun has studied <strong>palmistry</strong> for over fifteen years, approaching it as both an art and a living science. Palmistry reflects a feedback loop with the nervous system itself — as our lives shift, so too can the hands. He blends traditional and modern techniques, incorporating psychological, health-based, and empirical research in each interpretation.</p>

                <p>At the heart of Shaun’s work is a passion for <strong>deep personal growth</strong>. Growth should always be self-directed — but sometimes, we all need a place to pause, reflect, and open ourselves to guidance. Cosmic Pitstop exists to offer that brief stop along your journey.</p>
